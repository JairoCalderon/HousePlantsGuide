                            ivy, ribbon plant, and hen and chickens is a species of perennial flowering plant. It is
                            native to tropical
                            and southern Africa, but has become naturalized in other parts of the world, including
                            western Australia.

                        <p>Chlorophytum comosum is a popular houseplant. The species with all-green leaves forms only a
                            small proportion
                            of plants sold.</p>

                                often sold in
                                hanging baskets to display the plantlets. The long stems are white.

                        <p>It is an evergreen perennial plant forming dense stands, spreading by way of its creeping
                            rhizome, which is
                            sometimes above ground, sometimes underground. Its stiff leaves grow vertically from a basal
                            rosette. Mature
                            leaves are dark green with light gray-green cross-banding and usually range from 70–90
                            centimetres (28–35
                            in) long and 5–6 centimetres (2.0–2.4 in) wide, though it can reach heights above 2 m (6 ft)
                            in optimal
                            conditions</p>
                        <p>It is now used predominantly as an ornamental plant, outdoors in warmer climates, and indoors
                            as a houseplant
                            in cooler climates. It is popular as a houseplant because it is tolerant of low light levels
                            and irregular
                            watering; during winter it needs only one watering every couple of months. It will rot
                            easily if
                            overwatered.</p>

                        <p>Philodendron is a large genus of flowering plants in the Araceae family. As of September
                            2015, the World
                            Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepted 489 species; other sources accept different
                            numbers.
                            Regardless of number of species, the
                            genus is the second-largest member of the Araceae family. Taxonomically, the genus
                            Philodendron is still
                            poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants.
                        </p>
                        <p>The name derives from the Greek words philo- or "love, affection" and dendron or "tree". They
                            are commonly
